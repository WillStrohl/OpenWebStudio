## About Open Web Studio (OWS) - A DotNetNuke Extension
Open Web Studio is a complete development platform, allowing you to create any module you would like, from the ground up, all from the comfort of your own browser, using an easy to pick up syntax and action driven flow that anyone can learn. 

# Interface

It's a familiar layout similar to what you experience within Visual Studio and the Microsoft office suite. We built the interface from the ground up with the user in mind. All aspects of the environment are intuitive and easy to use and accessible from anywhere since the whole framework is online and not on your desktop.

# Ribbon
Rounding out the administrative interface is a fluent ribbon control we call jRibbon which has the look and feel of the Microsoft Ribbon control, but has a tiny javascript footprint. This control will be available on its own as a free open source project thru the google code site.

# Architecture
The technology behind the interface is advanced, using Javascript and JSON to handle the majority of the runtime and the storage of the configurations.

# Platforms
Open Web Studio is not bound to any specific platform. DotNetNuke is where we continue to spend a great deal of time and energy, we cannot forget that there are other solutions on the market that employ .Net. The architecture is built from the ground up using a plugin approach that would allow any .net developer to port OWS into their preferred platform. This means an application built in any OWS platform will be interoperable with the other. You can build apps for both Sharepoint and DNN without changing anything in your code configurations

# Packages and Skin Controls
Just like you can create modules and solutions with Open Web Studio, you can also utilize these as Skin elements and even full blown PA modules and distribute these because of the OWS portability. Build your solutions and use them on multiple portals simply by packaging your solution and installing the OWS engine and package on the site.

# Extensions
OWS would not have the level of versatility possible if it wasn't so extendable. While out of the box you can do pretty much anything you could imagine, we also took into consideration times when you as the developer come up with something that "we" couldn't imagine. Out of the box we provide samples of creating your own syntax, formats and runtime tasks. Extensions are easy to create and are linked to the runtime via a standard configuration file.

The OWS Quick Builder enables the everyday non-technical person to build data sourced modules from an existing table structures. This allows OWS to build advanced data related forms with search, filter, sort, add, view, update and delete quickly. For experienced engineers the Quick Builder provides a fast method for starting your development creating a rich UI experience in just a few clicks.

# Support and Learning OWS
We have a growing number of examples that exist with open web studio, some simple examples and how to and others, like our Wiki are full blown modules that replace the need for any competing module of the same type. Because we are releasing as open source, we will also be releasing large packages meant to be used as either example or modules themselves from wiki and issue tracking to just about any other need.
